My paper "Mutation Testing to Support the Security Testing of Android Applications" <a href="https://cbsoft.sbc.org.br/2024/sast/artigos/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">has been published in the Brazilian Conference on Software: Practice and Theory (CBSoft)</a>, an annual event promoted by the Brazilian Computing Society (SBC). CBSoft is one of the main conferences of the Brazilian scientific community on Computing.

This paper resulted from my Master's research and I've received <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7247207233342623744/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CBSOFT's Distinguished Paper Award for it</a>. This national-level award for academic research excellence in software engineering highlights the impact and significance of my contributions to advancing the fields of software engineering and software security testing.
